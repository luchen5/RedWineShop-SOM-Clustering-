# RedWineShop-SOM-Clustering

Implementation of SOM (Self Organizing Map) to visualize the result that is needed.

# Description

Red Wine Online Shop

Red Wine Online Shop is e-commerce based in US which focuses on the quality issues of red wine. To make their job more efficient, Red Wine Online Shop wants to build a model that could predict the overall quality of the red wine from their ingredients. Red Wine Online Shop also wants to cluster customer’s intention from customer behavior in the website. Therefore, as a programmer, you are asked to help them build the application based on the existing dataset.

1.	Clustering (Self-Organizing Map)
First, Red Wine Online Shop wants to group the user based on the similarities in user behaviors. To do that, you are going to use Kohonen Self-Organizing Map technique to cluster the data.

a.	Dataset Description
Content
The given dataset contains 3,632 data consisting of behavior information of all Red Wine Online Shop users in the web page. 

Feature Description
	The table below shows the feature descriptions in the dataset.

b.	Feature Selection
Instead of using the actual value for the clustering, you are asked to create features derived from the actual data. The features requested are:

c.	Feature Extraction
After the five new features are extracted, you are asked to use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to both clean the data and reduce the dimensionality even further.
The steps that you want to take are as follows:
1.	Select the features as defined in the Feature Selection section
2.	Normalize the data
3.	Analyze the data with Principal Component Analysis to obtain the new components
4.	Take the highest 3 principal components as the input of your neural network

d.	Architecture
You are to create your own architecture design that will be able to solve the given problem. Consider the following when building your architecture:
•	Number of input nodes required
•	Number of clusters
These considerations will be accounted for in the grading process.

e.	Training
The training procedure of the neural network are as follows:
1.	Epoch for the trainings is 5000
2.	For each data in the dataset, find the winning node by using nearest distance
3.	Update the neighbor around the winning node in a square pattern
4.	Update the weight of the network

f.	Visualization
After the training is complete, use matplotlib to visualize the clusters generated by the self-organizing map.

The dataset is obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/roshansharma/online-shoppers-intention) by Roshan Sharma. The dataset has been heavily cleaned and modified for the purpose of this case.
